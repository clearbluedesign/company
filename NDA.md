#### Scenario 3:  Allowed

In the event that Clear Blue Design has partial equity ownership of The Client or receives any sort of ongoing recurring compensation (revenue sharing, profit sharing, etc.) then Clear Blue Design will be considered “engaged in business” with The Client as long as those structures are in place.

#### Scenario 10:  Allowed
